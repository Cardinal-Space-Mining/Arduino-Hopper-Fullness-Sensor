To Do:
Physical:
  make both board
  make cables
  drill holes (mountinging and cable)
  mount boards

code:
  fix serial recognition
  Arduino code for up to 8 ports
  algorithm to convert array to single float
  
testing:
  graph??
  file of all running data

looking into using system of equations for more accurate resistance readings

Today: 3/29/25

I need to figure out what more I need to do. I need to make sure I can get my publisher to work and publish whatever the Arduino says. I need to make a thing that takes that takes the Arduino arrays and makes it into a float. I also would like to look more into the circuitry and try to make that better. I also need to make them and drill new holes into everything. 


finish the ROS publisher and talk to the Arduino 
converting the array to float
look into circuitry and try to find what is wrong
make boards 
connect boards
