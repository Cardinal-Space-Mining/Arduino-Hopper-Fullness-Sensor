Current plan
use the 74HC4067
Have up to 16 photoresistors inputs
NEED TO FIND A GOOD RESISTOR VALUE FOR VOLTAGE DEVIDOR 
will need to use 1 resistor for every 1 photoresistor

Need to find the range of the photoresistors in the condition and try to have them on the extremas of the voltage. 0V low, 5V High

7 wires
  2 Power (Positive/Negitive)
  4 Select pins 
  1 Analog pin
