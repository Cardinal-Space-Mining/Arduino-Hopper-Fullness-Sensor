Current plan
use the 74HC4067
Have up to 16 photoresistors inputs
NEED TO FIND A GOOD RESISTOR VALUE FOR VOLTAGE DEVIDOR 
will need to use 1 resistor for every 1 photoresistor

7 wires
  2 Positive/Negitive
  4 Select pins 
  1 Analog pin 

could have USB on one side and Deutsch connector or another type but that is for another time
