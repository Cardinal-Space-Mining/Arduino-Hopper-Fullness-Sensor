Current plan
use the 74HC4067
Have up to 16 photoresistors inputs
NEED TO FIND A GOOD RESISTOR VALUE FOR VOLTAGE DEVIDOR 
will need to use 1 resistor for every 1 photoresistor

Will in theory only need 3 wires needs to find some good connectors
will only need 3 wires so that gives a ton of options 
could have USB on one side and Deutsch connector or another type but that is for another time
